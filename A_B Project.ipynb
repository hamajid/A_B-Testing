    "\n",
    "At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses have two options on the home page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\". If the user clicks on the \"start free trial\", he will be asked to enter his credit card information, and he will be enrolled for the paid version of the course for free during the 14 days free trail period. After 14 days, if the user didn't cancel the enrollment he will be automatically charged for the courses.\n",
    "The second option, 'access course materials' does not require a credit card information and gives full access to the course materials and quizzes excluding project feedback, coaching service and verified certificate.\n",
    "For this experiment Udacity tested a change where those users who clicked \"start free trial\" were asked how much time they were willing to devote to the course. If the answer is 5 or more hours per week they will be taken through the checkout process as usual. If the users are not devoting to spend at least 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating the need for a greater time commitment to enable success and suggesting they might like to access the free content.\n",
    "The hypothesis was that this change might set clearer expectations for the student, and reduce the number of frustrated students who left the 14 day trial because they did not have enough time to work on the course. The change also should not significantly reduce the number of students who continued past the free trial and eventually completed the course. \n",
    "So if Gross conversion for the experiment group is lower than that in the control group. This indicates that the change is effective in communicating to prospective students the time commitment needed to be successful in the course, and we expect this change to be significant statistically and practically. Also the net conversion for the experiment group is not significantly lower than that in the control group, we would like that the net conversion to do not be practically or statistically significant\n",
    "The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the user / student enrolls in the free trial, a user-id is generated and used to track the user from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page. \n",

    "Here is the list of metrics chosen to be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of Cookies** : That is, number of unique cookies to visit the course overview page. The reason of using it is because it is the unit of diversion for the project and therefore an equal number of cookies would be expected. Also because the number of cookies are counted before the users are exposed to the experiment in each group. It is a good invariant metric because it's being directly randomized between experiment and control group. Is a bad evaluation metric because it won't be different between experiment and control.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of Clicks**: That is, number of users who enroll in the free trial. The reason of using it as invariant metric is because the clicks are pre-experiment and it’s expected to not change between the control and experiment group, in other word the clicks happen before the exposure of the users to the experiment, and the number of clicks should be equal in each group because only the users exposed to experiment are the only one will be in the experiment. I didn’t choose it as a variant metric it won't be different between experiment and control.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Click-through Probability**: That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. Since this is a ratio between the numbers of users to click the free trial button over the number of unique cookies to visit the course overview page, it is a good invariant metric and bad evaluation metric because it’s expected to remind unchanged for both groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gross Conversion**: he number of users to enroll in free trial over the number of clicks. This will be tracked by using user ids. The reason that this was chosen as an evaluation metric is that measure the number of enrolled student after been answering the 5 hours or more commitment to the class question, and it will create a variation between the control and experiment groups. And that what we are trying to measure. So the number of enrolled students will not be the same for the control and experiment groups, for that reason it is a good evaluation metric and bad invariant metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Net Conversion**: The number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the “Start free trial” button. And this also tracked and measured with user ids. The reason that this was chosen as an evaluation metric is that measure the number of enrolled student that pay for the course after the 14 free trial days. So the net conversion is a good evaluation metric because it will change from control to experiment groups’ because the number of user ids will not be the same. And we can’t use it as invariant metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unused Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of user-ids** : The number of users to enroll in the free trial. User-ids are only tracked after a student enrolls in the course, so this is not a good choice as an invariant metric because the user-ids are counted after the click occurs, and therefore will be effected by the test, which means that we would expect to have different distributions and there is no way to normalize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retention**: The number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by number of user-ids to complete checkout. The reason that this was not chosen as an evaluation metric even though it tells us exactly how many users remained enrolled after the 14 days trial period, is because it would cause the experiment to take too long, also it's using different units for the analysis and diversion, which can lead to inaccuracies, furthermore Gross Conversion and Net Conversion are good enough for testing our hypothesis.\n",

The Bonferroni correction would recommend the change if any metric would show the statistical significance.\n",

In other word there were a decrease in enrollment that was accompanied by no differences in conversions to enrollment from the trial period, so this experiment was not effective in accomplishing it's goals. \n",

The hypothesis would be that the new enrollee will have enough information about the courses and what is expected from him and also it will be the time for the potential student to ask questions that may clear up ambiguity\n",
